Machine Learning Project on Mental Health in Tech Survey

## Introduction
Our team is embarking on a project to analyze mental health in the tech industry using a dataset from Kaggle's 2014 "Mental Health in Tech Survey." We aim to apply machine learning to predict the necessity for mental health treatment based on survey data. The dataset contains 1258 samples with 27 features involving strings, boolean values and integers.

## Dataset Details
[The Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)

## Objectives
We plan to conduct our analysis with the following steps: In the initial phase, we will do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to use logistic regression to identify key predictors, and visualize the EDA results with histograms, scatter plots or other appropriate plots. We then conduct data preprocessing involving feature selection, data cleansing and wrangling.While our analysis methods and goals may shift as the project progresses, our current plan focuses on classification algorithms involving random forest and Adaboost. We will evaluate our models and visualize the prediction performance using AUC plots and other appropriate visualizations.
